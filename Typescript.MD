# Typescript-Bascis


* Typescript is an It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language
* Basically typescript is essentially javascript with type checking with typescript
* Which means set the type of variables 
* The greate feature is that  ```TypeChecking```
* This will boost the features like code completion and refactoring
## Benefints of typescript
- static typing
- code completion 
- refactoring 
- ```shorthand notation```
    
    Shorthand notations are a part of the Wolfram Language's rich syntax system that allows multiple ways to feed arguments to functions.
## Drawbacks

1. completion
  In this time browser don understand the typescript code, So we created the sepparate identifiers like ```.ts``` and ```.js```
- Where the typescript ompiler is compiled and translate to javascript.
  The process is alled as ```Transpilation```
2. Dicsipline in coding
- There are some typing and transpilies to javascript
